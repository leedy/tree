## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB server (accessible locally or remotely)
- npm or yarn

## Quick Start

### Raspberry Pi Deployment (Recommended for Production)

**For complete Raspberry Pi setup with systemd services and auto-start:**

📖 **See [RASPBERRY_PI_SETUP.md](RASPBERRY_PI_SETUP.md)** for the full guide

This is the recommended way to run Tree on a Truck in production on your home network.

### Local Development Setup

For development on your laptop/desktop:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leedy/tree.git
cd tree
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template and configure
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your MongoDB credentials and settings

# Start the backend server
npm run dev
```

The backend server will start on **http://localhost:3001**

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template (optional - defaults to localhost:3001)
cp .env.template .env

# Start the frontend development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at **http://localhost:5173**

## Environment Variables

Both backend and frontend require `.env` files. Templates are provided.

### Backend (.env)

**Location:** `backend/.env`

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.template .env
nano .env  # Edit with your values
```

**Configuration:**
```env
# MongoDB Configuration
MONGO_HOST=your-mongodb-host          # IP or hostname
MONGO_PORT=27017
MONGO_USERNAME=your-username          # Leave empty if no auth
MONGO_PASSWORD=your-password          # Leave empty if no auth
MONGO_DATABASE=treeonatruck

# Server Configuration
PORT=3001                             # Use 3002 if 3001 is taken

# JWT Secret (IMPORTANT: Change in production!)
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-secret-key

# Season dates (Black Friday to Christmas Eve)
SEASON_START_MONTH=11
SEASON_START_DAY=25
SEASON_END_MONTH=12
SEASON_END_DAY=24

# Email Configuration (for contact form)
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com        # Gmail address (must be @gmail.com)
EMAIL_PASS=your-gmail-app-password     # Gmail App Password (NOT regular password)
EMAIL_TO=your-email@example.com        # Where to receive contact messages
```

### Frontend (.env)

**Location:** `frontend/.env`

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.template .env
nano .env  # Edit with your values
```

**For local development:**
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

**For Raspberry Pi deployment:**
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://YOUR_PI_IP:3002
```

**IMPORTANT:**
- Do NOT use `localhost` for Pi deployment - use actual IP
- Do NOT add `/api` at the end (it's added automatically)
- Must match the PORT in backend .env

## Contact Form

Tree on a Truck includes a contact form that allows users to send messages via email.

### Email Setup (Gmail)

The contact form uses Gmail SMTP to send emails. Follow these steps to configure:

#### 1. Enable 2-Step Verification

1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Scroll to "How you sign in to Google"
3. Click "2-Step Verification" and set it up

**Note:** App Passwords only work with personal @gmail.com accounts, NOT Google Workspace accounts with custom domains.

#### 2. Create App Password

1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords (after enabling 2-Step Verification)
2. Select "Mail" as the app
3. Select "Other (Custom name)" and enter "Tree App"
4. Click "Generate"
5. Copy the 16-character password shown

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Edit `backend/.env`:

```env
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com        # Your @gmail.com address
EMAIL_PASS=abcd efgh ijkl mnop        # The 16-char app password (spaces ok)
EMAIL_TO=where-you-want@example.com   # Can be any email address
```

**Important Notes:**
- `EMAIL_USER` must be a **@gmail.com** address
- `EMAIL_PASS` is the **App Password**, NOT your regular Gmail password
- `EMAIL_TO` can be any email address (where you want to receive messages)

### Accessing the Contact Form

The contact form is available at:
- **Logged-in users:** Click "Contact" in the header navigation
- **Public access:** `/contact` route (linked on landing page)
- **Direct URL:** http://localhost:5174/contact (development)

### Features

- Name, email, and message fields
- Client-side validation (10-2000 character limit)
- Server-side validation and error handling
- Formatted HTML emails with sender information
- Success/error messages for user feedback
- Mobile-responsive design

### Troubleshooting Email

If emails aren't sending:

1. **Check credentials:** Verify `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` in `.env`
2. **App Password:** Make sure you're using the App Password, not your regular Gmail password
3. **Gmail account:** Confirm you're using a @gmail.com account, not a custom domain
4. **2-Step Verification:** Ensure it's enabled on your Google account
5. **Backend logs:** Check the backend terminal for specific error messages

## Admin System

Tree on a Truck includes a comprehensive admin panel for managing teams, seasons, and activities.

### Creating an Admin Account

**First time setup:**

```bash
cd backend
node scripts/createAdmin.js
```

You'll be prompted to enter:
- Admin username (minimum 3 characters)
- Admin email address
- Admin password (minimum 6 characters)

The script will create your admin account and you can then login at `/admin/login`.

### Accessing the Admin Panel

**Development:** http://localhost:5173/admin/login
**Production:** http://YOUR_PI_IP:4173/admin/login

Login with the username and password you created.

### Admin Features

The admin dashboard provides four main sections:

#### 1. Overview
- View total statistics (teams, players, trees, activities)
- See active season information
- Monitor overall app usage

#### 2. Team Management
- View all registered teams with their stats
- **Edit team details** (team name and email address)
  - ⭐ **Critical for fixing existing teams:** Add email addresses to teams that were created before the email requirement
- Delete teams (removes all associated data and activities)
- View player counts and tree totals per team

#### 3. Season Management
- Create new seasons with custom date ranges
- Edit existing seasons (dates, year)
- Set which season is currently active
- Delete unused seasons (cannot delete if teams are using it)
- View season details (start date, end date, active status)

#### 4. Activity Management
- View recent activity log (last 100 activities)
- See who added/removed trees and when
- Delete inappropriate or spam activities
- Monitor team activity in real-time

### Admin Use Cases

**Common admin tasks:**

1. **Adding emails to existing teams:**
   - Go to Teams tab
   - Click "Edit" on team missing email
   - Enter their email address
   - Click "Save"
   - Team can now login with email + password

2. **Starting a new season:**
   - Go to Seasons tab
   - Click "Create Season"
   - Enter year, start date, end date
   - Check "Active Season" to make it current
   - Click "Save"

3. **Removing spam/test data:**
   - Go to Activities tab
   - Find test activities
   - Click "Delete" on each one

4. **Emergency team deletion:**
   - Go to Teams tab
   - Click "Delete" on team
   - Confirm (this removes ALL team data)

### Admin Security

- Admin authentication is completely separate from team authentication
- Admin tokens expire after 7 days (vs 30 days for teams)
- Admin routes are protected by middleware that verifies admin status
- Admin passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage
